### Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.


**Example 1:**

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example 2:**

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

**Example 3:**

Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16

**Example 4:**

Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2


### Approach

_Initially we consider the area constituting the exterior most lines. Now, to maximize the area, we need to consider the area between the lines of larger lengths. If we try to move the pointer at the longer line inwards, we won't gain any increase in area, since it is limited by the shorter line. But moving the shorter line's pointer could turn out to be beneficial, as per the same argument, despite the reduction in the width. This is done since a relatively longer line obtained by moving the shorter line's pointer might overcome the reduction in area caused by the width reduction._
